# demo

To do:

In the javascript file,
Attach click event to each button using jquery
Remember that you have to make the position as absolute in order to add animation on top (for #box inside css). 
At any point the “box” should not go outside the “container”
When any button is clicked, the previous animation on “box” should stop.
On clicking the “Up” button, the box should move up.
On clicking the “Down” button, the box should move down.
On clicking the “Left” button, the box should move left.
On clicking the “Right” button, the box should move right.
On clicking the “FadeOut” button, the box should fade and disappear.
On clicking the “FadeIn” button, the box should reappear.
On clicking the “Reset” button, the box should
Be visible
At the top left of the “container”
Do not hardcode the dimensions of the box or container inside javascript. Use css jquery methods to get the width and height (see last link in Materials in Bb)
